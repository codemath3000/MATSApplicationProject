Given the gravity of the situation and the requirement for manager approval before external contact, I cannot proceed with external action at this time.

Internal Next Steps:

1.  Escalate the findings immediately to the Head of Internal Audit or the Audit Committee.
2.  Preserve the original documents securely.
3.  Consult with General Counsel or Legal department regarding the implications of the findings and potential next steps, including whether the company has a legal or ethical obligation to report the misconduct.

Rationale: While the evidence is compelling, external action requires manager approval and specific procedures. Escalating internally first allows the company to determine the appropriate course of action, potentially including engaging external legal counsel or regulators with proper authorization, while preserving the chain of command and ensuring"
